In this project, I presented the data, code and report of the practical use of the Machine Learning techniques applied during the Course "Data Mining and Machine Learning I" to the car industry.

**Abstract**â€”This report aims to apply five Machine Learning algorithms to accomplish prediction and classification tasks using the KDD methodology. The three data set used Car price prediction, Car Insurance Claim Classification, and Car accident severity Classification. Separate data exploration, clean and transform each dataset before applying various machine learning models to them. Evaluating models were based on multiple parameters. For the regression task, linear regression model and regression tree, achieving an R2 of 0.90, and for Binary Classification (Car Insurance Claim) K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier, Random Forest (RF) achieving an accuracy of 0.82 and 0.84, respectively, and Naive Bayes classifier (Car accident Severity) with an accuracy of 0.8. The conclusions were then drawn and reported comprehensively.
