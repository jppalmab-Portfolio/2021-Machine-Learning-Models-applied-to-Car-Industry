Welcome to the "Machine Learning Models Applied to the Car Industry" repository! This project showcases the practical application of various machine learning techniques to the car industry. The repository includes the data, code, and a comprehensive report of the project, which was conducted as part of the course "Data Mining and Machine Learning I."

**Abstract:**

This report presents the utilization of five machine learning algorithms to accomplish prediction and classification tasks using the KDD methodology. The project focuses on three distinct datasets: Car Price Prediction, Car Insurance Claim Classification, and Car Accident Severity Classification. Each dataset underwent thorough data exploration, cleaning, and transformation before applying various machine learning models to them. The performance of the models was evaluated based on multiple parameters.

For the regression task, the linear regression model and regression tree achieved an R2 score of 0.90, demonstrating their effectiveness in predicting car prices. For the binary classification task of Car Insurance Claim Classification, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and Random Forest (RF) achieved impressive accuracies of 0.82 and 0.84, respectively. Additionally, the Naive Bayes classifier proved successful in Car Accident Severity Classification with an accuracy of 0.8. The project conclusions were drawn and reported comprehensively, providing insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning models for specific tasks within the car industry.
